# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the cost of certification?
For [members](https://www.cncf.io/about/members/) of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, there is no charge for certification. There is also no charge for non-profit organizations. For commercial organizations that wish to certify but don't want to become a CNCF member, the fee is the same as [joining](https://www.cncf.io/about/join/) the CNCF.

## Is a participation form required per company or per product?
Per product. Each separate product (i.e., different product name) from your company requires a different [participation form](https://github.com/cncf/cnf-certification/blob/main/Certified_CNF_Form.md). Submit a signed Participation Form using [DocuSign](https://na4.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=cb6ee2b7-ee9d-48c5-b154-abfab626a21f&env=na4&acct=99530ead-94da-4299-b0ca-9df20e86a064&v=2).
